you need to use unity hub to open my source project. 
I use unity 2020.3.4f
click big continue button to restart
small button to start the game
use https://www.spriters-resource.com/search/?q=flappy+bird for source finding
On top of that, I use the material as the object, and control my cse472 ball.
